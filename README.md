## Objective

Develop a timetable application designed to assist in scheduling and managing time slots for college faculties and students. Faculties should be able to easily schedule and manage class time slots on specific days according to their preferences. Meanwhile, students should have the capability to view the finalized timetable and plan their activities accordingly.

## Getting Started

This project is written in Visual Studio Code. So this project contains VS_Code specific configuration files. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
